/*
  Write a function, hammingDistance, that takes two strings of
  the same length (representing two DNA strands) and returns the
  hamming distance between the two strings. 

  The hamming distance is found by comparing two DNA strands and
  counting how many of the nucleotides are different from their 
  equivalent positions in the other string.

  The hamming distance of the following two strands of DNA is 7.
